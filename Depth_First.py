Depth-First Search (DFS) Overview
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph systematically.
It explores as far down one branch as possible before backtracking.
DFS can be implemented using either recursion (implicitly using the call stack) or iteration (using an explicit stack).
Itâ€™s useful for tasks like finding connected components, detecting cycles, topological sorting, and solving puzzles like mazes.

Time Complexity: O(V+E), 
where 
V is the number of vertices and 
E is the number of edges.

Explanation of the Code
Graph Representation:
The graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a node, and the value is a list of its neighbors.
Example:
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

Iterative DFS (Stack):
We use a stack to keep track of nodes to visit.
Nodes are visited in depth-first order by popping from the stack.
Recursive DFS:
The function uses recursion to visit each node.
The visited set ensures that each node is only visited once.
Output
For both versions (iterative and recursive), 

DFS traversal starting from A:
['A', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'C']

Recursive DFS traversal:
A B D E F C
